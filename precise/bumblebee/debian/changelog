bumblebee (3.2.1-1~preciseppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - fixed Bumblebee 3.2 not working on a lot of setups. This happened because
      of "Device" section splitting in xorg conf files.
    - fixed an issue where an empty XorgModulePath lead to -isolateDecide being
      removed from Xorg start command line instead of -modulepath.

bumblebee (3.2-1~preciseppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - implemented -b none option for optirun to disable injection of any render
      offloading bridge (primus or VirtualGL). Use this to invoke
      nvidia-settings (optirun -b none nvidia-settings -c :8).
    - implemented --no-xorg option for optirun to disable starting secondary X
      server. Use this to run CUDA or OpenCL applications that do not need the
      graphics rendering capabilities. Implies -b none.
    - added support for passing -configdir to X, defaulting to
      /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.d, --xconfdir option added to bumblebeed and
      XorgConfDir added to bumblebee.conf; this finally fixes a long-standing
      annoyance with SNA config option for the Intel driver.
    - minor changes in xorg.conf files: unified Device[01] toDiscreteNvidia,
      moved BusID to xorg.conf.d/busid.conf.
    - added --primus-ldpath and PrimusLibraryPath options to set
      PRIMUS_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    - we do not depend on primusrun script anymore for primus backend, note
      that primusrun and optirun -b primus will have different behavior, the
      first one will power on the discrete GPU when needed, while the second
      one will do it immediately; the difference in behavior is most noticeable
      with WebGL content in Firefox.
    - added /usr/$LIB/mesa/libGL.so.1 to default primus libGLd for supporting
      Ubuntu 13.04.
    - fixed --pidfile documentation.
    - fixed a "buffer overflow" issue in bumblebeed.
    - removed accesses to PCI config space from the daemon process.

  * debian/*:
    - fully reworked packaging scripts, synced with Ubuntu upstream Debian.

bumblebee (3.1-1~preciseppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Support for primus as an alternative to virtualgl as optirun back-end.
      Added a new Bridge option in bumblebee.conf to set the default back-end
      (auto as default currently, selects VirtualGL if installed, else primus,
      detection order may change in 4.0). optirun gained a -b/--bridge option
      for on-the-fly back-end choice.
    - Use of non-blocking sockets, replacing former 3.0.1 hotfix for socket
      polling.
    - Added an udev rule to fix nvidia card randomly turning on.
    - Fixed the three remaining compilation warnings.
    - A little fix for Kepler generation cards was added in xorg.conf.nvidia
    - A little fix for dual nvidia hybrid systems.
    - Fixed nouveau not working under X.org 1.13+.
    - Upstart dependencies changed to fix some issues.
    - Fixed available drivers detection by supporting module aliases.
  * Ubuntu changes
    - Support for all existing flavors of nvidia proprietary drivers with a new
      modprobe blacklist file and a new upstart initscript for driver detection.
  * debian/control:
    - Suggest primus.
  * debian/pachtes:
    - drop 006-set-vgl-readback-pbo.patch [upstream]
    - drop 007-nvidia-fallback-probe.patch: Replaced by the new upstart script.

bumblebee (3.0.1-2~preciseppa1) precise; urgency=low
  * debian/patches:
    - add 007-nvidia-fallback-probe.patch: The KernelDriver name could either
      be nvidia, nvidia-current or nvidia-current-updates, depending on where
      you get it from (xorg-edgers, ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates), and which version
      you have. We use nvidia-current as default because this is the most
      common value, but as it may change, we try the other ones in case it
      fails.
  * updated buildscript in order to respect standards:
    - Standards-Version set to 3.9.3
    - compat set to 9
    - debhelper dependency set to 9.0.0~
    - updated copyright to 2012 and added myself to it
    - removed useless prerm script
    - removed useless call to ldconfig in bumblebee-nvidia
    - set bumblebee-nvidia as a meta-package
    - fixed lintian error with setting Pre-Depends on dpkg
